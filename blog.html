        <div class="blog-content-normal">For e-commerce return application in EWM, we set us two most important goals:</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub"><strong class="seq">1.</strong> From user experience perspective, we ought to provide helpful and neat guide in proper timing, to assist warehouse clerk process returned product correctly and efficiently. &nbsp;
          <br><strong class="seq">2.</strong>Program on existing system to initiate return process from EWM, recording all the useful information of inspection process to return order creation. At the mean time, the commitment time shall be rigidly short.</div>

      <h1>Lead Smooth Inspection &amp; Trigger Return Process in EWM</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We had remote and face-to-face interview over 10 times with target user, asking open-ended questions and contextual inquiries for quantitive data, like their general workflow. We had field observation in warehouse and directed storytelling to collect qualitative data, such as how they make mistakes. Our questions and observations mostly trying to figure out following questions:</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub"><strong class="seq">1.</strong> How warehouse clerk process returned items in your business? Any difference in this process between warehouses in different areas? &nbsp;("Could you walk us through the return process?") &nbsp;
          <br><strong class="seq">2.</strong> How do you record unplanned return products in system currently? What else is wanted to improve your business process? &nbsp;("What would you when you have returned goods without record in system?") &nbsp;
          <br><strong class="seq">3.</strong> In which step does error or slip happen? &nbsp;("What mistake did you make last month/week?") &nbsp;
          <br><strong class="seq">4.</strong> Any other system is related to return process? Did you develop your program? &nbsp; ("What other tool do you use?")</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">To avoid bias assumption, we asked every team member to take notes of what they heard and what they observed. (Since individual member has his specialized domain of SAP system, it was proofed to be an effective technique to help us understand the situation thoroughly.) After sorted out the huge amount of notes token by the team, we synthesized core elements in work flow:</div><img class="blog-content-img" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 94vw, (max-width: 767px) 61vw, (max-width: 991px) 458px, 670px" src="images/data-io---s.PNG" srcset="images/data-io---s-p-500x246.png 500w, images/data-io---s.PNG 700w" width="745">

      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Prototyping</h1>
      <h1>Validate our Solution</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">For UI harmonization, we decided to use <a href="http://www.sap.com/product/technology-platform/fiori.html">Fiori</a> ramework for return application. Compared to my other more flexible prototyping experience, I had challenging time designing within constraints of <a href="https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design/">Fiori design guideline</a>. I also learnt a lot from Fiori central design team when we prepare to pass design gate, which made me think seriously for information architecture in UI design: the placement of a button is crucial for its semantic meanings. Especially when we design in a framework, we should be very careful with the location of each element to avoid confusion.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Fiori has great role-based floorpan to supporting transaction of monitoring and pipeline business. But in this return app, we hope to link return clerk’s physical activities with the system interaction. For building <a href="http://www.sharritt.com/CISHCIExam/norman.html">conceptual model</a>, we had two major problems:</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub"><strong class="seq">1.</strong> How to sequence and prioritize all the actions in a singe page, so that the user could finish task without bother to scroll? How to arrange secondary information? It would be too much if all pop-ups &nbsp;
          <br><strong class="seq">2.</strong> Return clerk wants to execute put-away in system when HU (handling unit) is full of returned product, and sometimes needs to create a new HU. How to reflect two actions in the system, and avoid interruption/confusion? </div><img class="blog-content-img" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 94vw, (max-width: 767px) 61vw, (max-width: 991px) 458px, 670px" src="images/returnss---s.PNG" srcset="images/returnss---s-p-500x262.png 500w, images/returnss---s.PNG 695w" width="699">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We re-examined user scenarios, and categorized user input into "necessary", "occasionally necessary" and "nice-to-have". We surely gave first priority to the necessary input, and put nice-to-have features in lower positions. For occasional data, take serial number as an example. Users mainly capture it on a pop-up window, and able to check or modify it later by clicking tagged abbreviated information on main page.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We also designed a group of toggle buttons for condition selection, to restrain user from making mistakes.(This was proved to be effective in A/B test) And the content of those buttons are customizable to provide more flexibility for different business. Final version of Axure prototype after four times iteration cannot be posted here due to non-disclosure agreement.</div>

    <div class="blog-content-contianer w-container">
      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Test</h1>
      <h1 class="blog-section-header">Warehouse Staff Wants our Application</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We had our prototype send to usability test, letting real warehouse clerk play with the prototype. Two of our developer colleagues were able to be on customer site. With the pictures of working scene in warehouse, they dictated how Roberta used our software and what she said, so that the team could find out problems by their individual understanding. Then we collected important items written by the whole team.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub"><strong class="seq">1.</strong> They almost merely&nbsp;care about the destination and press “put-away” button repetitively for each item.&nbsp;
          <br><strong class="seq">2.</strong> They had to switch between scanner and mouse
          <br><strong class="seq">3.</strong> Operating on the screen may distract them from inspecting
          <br><strong class="seq">4.</strong> They couldn't see well which&nbsp;HU is full</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Accordingly, we calibrated our prototype.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub"><strong class="seq">1.</strong> We made the field of destination location much larger with color sign indicating the quality condition and next destination. And we made it clickable to execute put-away.
          <br><strong class="seq">2.</strong> We enabled the possibility to run through whole process by scanner without mouse and keyboard. For example, customer could configure a specific code representing put-away, and when user scan it, system would execute put-away. In this way, user could also be more focused on inspection process</div>

      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Outlook</h1>
      <h1 class="blog-section-header">The Future of E-commerce Return</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">In this project, I worked as user experience advocator first time with a team of developer and software architects. I was lucky to get this chance to practice design-driven software development (and part of data-driven user research), and test my design idea with real customers. At meantime, I enjoyed very much propelling my whole development team to think for users, and used information visualization to promote communication internally and externally. It motivates me when I know my work is producing value for users outside in warehouse and I could use their feedback to improve my work constantly. However, mission is not done yet, we still need to see how extendable our product is, and how this tool would meet user tendency in a larger scale. </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-content-contianer w-container">
      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Reflection</h1>
      <h1 class="blog-section-header">What we could do better</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">There are still things I am skeptical about. For example, the understanding phase is based on communication with managers and executives who make decision of purchasing our software, without involving the first stakeholder who directly uses our APP— warehouse return clerk. Would design iteration be better and more efficiency, if we involve them in the beginning before we have built our mind concept? How would we organize a gathering of warehouse clerks from different area? What should be prepare? </div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">It is painful to imagine that, end user only found bad usability issue which causes frequent errors, after the product is released to market, even though the product has passed the usability test in a given context — lab. Because of the company cooperation myths, we hardly have access to observe end user in requirement gathering phrase. (It also happens in another project I am working on recently.) Before I could convince the leadership invest more in customer relations, I am still thinking zealously that, with what was given, how to refine our design process to focus on the as best task as we can in each phrase.</div>
